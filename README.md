 # My Personal Project

## Project Proposal

***What will the application do?***

My food guide application will keep track of food locations that a user wants to try out. It lets a user enter food
locations, view information about them, and rate them. Possible features include listing all places that 
they've already eaten at; showing food locations with their website/menu link; rating them.

***Who will use it?***

Anyone who is a foodie, who loves trying out new food locations, and who needs a way to keep track of upcoming new food 
locations in the city.

***Why is this project of interest to me?***

I am a foodie, and I love trying out new places to eat. Because Vancouver has such a great food scene, there are
constantly new places opening up. It's hard to keep track of all of them and their corresponding details. So, this 
would let me keep track of all these places as soon as I know about them.
